'Hey <name>! How''s work?': ""
'Hey <name>! I heard that Benjamin gave you some tools and tips on how to run the farm, is that true?': ""
'Hey <name>! I want to buy some sugarcanes, do you have any or can you plant some for me?': ""
'Hey <name>! It''s about time we talk about something other than farming, don''t you think?': ""

'Hey <name>, Good timing! I want to expand on what I told you the other day.': ""
'Hey <name>, I forgot to tell you!': ""
'Hey <name>, I hadn''t seen you there. Don''t worry, I''m just doing some math here. Living the adult life, you know.': ""
'Hey <name>, I need to go early to bed so I can work tomorrow. Let''s hang out again some other time.': ""
'Hey <name>, I need to open the library now. Let''s hang out again some other time.': ""
'Hey <name>, I need your help again. I want to find a hobby, but I don''t have many ideas.': ""
'Hey <name>, I''m just about to go deliver the rooster you bought.': ""
'Hey <name>, It was super fun to play with you. Did you enjoy it too?': ""
'Hey <name>, can I ask you a question?': ""
'Hey <name>, can I ask you for help with something?': ""
'Hey <name>, can you help a girl out?<BR>I''m running out of ingredients for some medicines.<BR><BR>Right now I need 10 jasmines.

'Hey <name>, can you help me with something?': ""
'Hey <name>, congratulations! It was fun to play with you.': ""
'Hey <name>, do you have any animals on your farm yet? Brittany told me to give you one as a welcoming gift.': ""
'Hey <name>, don''t go to the restaurant today, alright?': ""
'Hey <name>, good to see you. I don''t talk to that many people, but you''re someone I like talking to. You always listen to what I say.': ""
'Hey <name>, if you bring me one of your chickens I can appraise it for you.': ""
'Hey <name>, it''s Devin here.<BR>Thank you for finding the materials for the project. I''ve built it overnight and left it at your mailbox.<BR>I hope you like it, because I had a lot of fun building it.<BR>I gave the final blueprints to Viktor, so you can ask him to craft you as many as you need now.': ""

'Hey <name>. Do you think I''m a nice guy? Do I treat you well?': ""
'Hey <name>. I won this time, but you weren''t bad either.': ""
'Hey <name>. I''ll be closing the restaurant now.': ""
'Hey <name>. I''m still trying to sell my rooster, are you interested?': ""
'Hey <name>. It''s time to close the store.': ""
'Hey <name>. There sure is, do you want to borrow it?': ""
'Hey Benjamin, we are trying to talk to the Curupira. Chloe said he likes some sugarcane rum. Do you think I can take some?': ""
'Hey Billy! Amanda asked me to talk to you about her Yak Manure.': ""
'Hey Brittany, I just gave a tuna to this turtle. It looks like she loved it.': ""

'Hey! Sorry I can''t work in your house with this weather.': ""
'Hey, are you the new farmer my sister Julia was talking about?': ""

'Hey, you showed some really good moves in there!': ""
'Hey, you''re good at this! Congratulations, <name>!': ""
'Hi <name>! Did you bring me <var:phiWeirdTreeItemName> I requested?': ""
'Hi <name>, no help is needed this time. I just wanted to give you a gift.': ""
'Hi <name>, thank you for talking to me those last few days. It''s good to have someone else to talk to.': ""
'Hi <name>, you''re still here! Not giving up on the farm yet?': ""

'Hi Benji! Were you taking a break?': ""

'Hi Richard, I''m new here. My name is <name>.': ""
'Hmm, a new expense with Richard... I won''t have any money left for the plan this month either.': ""

'How are you finding life here in Orange Town, <name>? Do you know your way around now?': ""
'How are your tools holding up? Not getting dull or chipped, are they? If you need ''em improved, you know where to bring ''em.': ""
'How can I repay you for that? Let''s hang out and I''ll think of something.': ""
'How can you even make the chickens run in a race? I thought they were going to just stay there, looking at each other.': ""
'How come?': ""
'How did you know I wanted one of those? Thanks a lot!': ""
'How do my sisters do it? They work so much, it''s scary...': ""
'How do you manage to wake up early in the morning every single day?': ""
'How does that work?': ""
'How often do you think about your past?': ""
'How''s farm life treating you, <name>? If your crops aren''t growing right, you gotta show ''em who''s boss by stomping on them a bit.': ""
'How''s the egg?': ""
'How''s the farm going, <name>? Are you getting sick of it yet?': ""
'How''s the farm life going, <name>? Have you broken any bones already?': ""
'How''s the farm these days? Raising plenty of delicious fruits and vegetables?': ""
'How''s the work on your farm going, <name>? Mine has never been the same since Stella left.': ""
'How...<wait> How do you know my name?': ""
'Howdy Partner. How''s your day?<BR>Mine''s been great. I watched some movies earlier and that always put me in a good mood.': ""
'Huh, I actually won the game! It''s been ages since that last happened.': ""
'Huh, there''s a note here, it says:<BR><color:positive>I''m out taking care of a pregnant dog, will be back soon.</color>': ""
'Huh, you found something?': ""
'Huh.. alright.': ""
'Huh?': ""
'Huh? Did you bring anything special?': ""
'Huh? Do you know me?': ""
'Huh? Is there something wrong with this one?': ""
'Huh? There''s an axe in this chest, but it''s broken.': ""
'Huh? What is it?': ""
'Hundreds of new conversations.': ""
'Hurry up already.': ""
'Hurry up and find this bouquet if you want to have a chance. Unless you want to skip to the next bouquet?': ""
'Hurry up!': ""
'I actually hate fishing, but I don''t like buying fish from Chloe or Serge every single day.': ""
'I actually wanted to give it to someone else in exchange for something I need.': ""
'I almost cried of happiness when he said that.': ""
'I almost died yesterday. Nathalia''s cat jumped on my back while I was distracted reading a book. I felt like my soul was leaving my body.': ""
'I already added one of those.': ""
'I already added too many ingredients.': ""
'I already expected as much.': ""
'I already gave a cake to all the kids in town, but I still have some more. Here''s one for you, <name>.': ""
'I already tamed a turtle.': ""
'I also make a very important note that in order to become a successful farmer you need to ship something everyday, no matter what happens.': ""
'I always liked this, it''s a good source of energy. Thanks!': ""
'I always spend some time with Ilda when I go out for a walk. She lives a very lonely life.': ""
'I always start the day with some black tea. It gives me strength to face all the paperwork.': ""
'I always wanted to be a furniture designer. Raphael taught me the basics of it when he worked here a couple years ago.': ""
'I always wanted to know a witch in real life.': ""
'I am! It was a slow day, but I couldn''t wait to leave and grab something to eat.': ""
'I appreciate your concern... But let me be myself from now on, alright?': ""
'I barely ever talk with my dad since mom and I moved here. I tried to call him today, but he didn''t answer.': ""
'I bought a new blender from a salesman that showed up earlier. It''s much bigger than my old one, I think I''ll be able to make that Rainbow Juice now.': ""
'I brought bird feed.': ""
'I brought the ingredient you need for your cake recipe. One <var:karlCakeIngredientName>, right?': ""
'I brought you a farming handbook. Do you want me to go over it with you?': ""
'I can also upgrade your tools for you <color:important>if you bring me the materials and money<color:default>. Stop by anytime.': ""
'I can cook here if I add some ingredients.': ""
'I can get her a job at my shop if that''s the problem.': ""
'I can give you a baby chicken if you want.': ""
'I can imagine.': ""
'I can kiss you now.': ""
'I can put bird feed here.': ""
'I can see that. I couldn''t keep up with you at all back there. And your right kick is stronger than anything I''ve seen before.': ""
'I can tell by the way you speak that you don''t want to be there.': ""
'I can''t believe I lost. I''m supposed to be the best at this game.': ""
'I can''t believe I won! My father must be proud!': ""
'I can''t believe I won! This money will be very helpful.': ""
'I can''t believe it! I was kidding when I said that! Hahahahaha!': ""
'I can''t believe my Horse won! After so many years I finally won this race!': ""
'I can''t believe this. I should have seen that coming.': ""
'I can''t carry anything else.': ""
'I can''t even tell the chickens apart anymore, so I won''t watch the race, but I like to come here when the whole town is together.': ""
'I can''t expand your house anymore. Not yet, at least.': ""
'I can''t fool you, right? I love eating those pizza slices. Thank you so much, <name>.': ""
'I can''t pick feed from the storage if my bag is full.': ""
'I can''t use this for cooking.': ""
'I can''t wait for the party to start.': ""
'I can''t, this is a waste of time!': ""
'I couldn''t participate on the games, I would probably end up cheating if I did.': ""
'I did! I had a great idea for your farm!': ""
'I did! I think she won''t be bothering me anytime soon now.': ""
'I did! Thank you for your hard work!': ""
'I didn''t add any ingredient.': ""
'I didn''t bring anything.': ""
'I didn''t have much of a choice, this is where I managed to get a farm.': ""
'I didn''t have time to make anything fancy for Candy Day, so I gave Richard a chocolate bar.': ""
'I didn''t know you could make your own ice cream.': ""
'I didn''t pay attention to Raphael''s chicken, because I never expected her to win, but I guess he did a good job raising her.': ""
'I didn''t win the lottery...': ""
'I do have one. Probably not for the reasons you expect, but I have it.': ""
'I do like my job, despite everything. I get to exercise and also get to see Nathalia.': ""
'I do. But I''ll only give it to you if you get me a <color:item>Pirate Diary</color>.': ""
'I do. I''ve been thinking of you all the time now.': ""
'I don''t care about the flowers, but my brother isn''t working today so I want to enjoy the day with him.': ""
'I don''t care. I won''t give it to you until I get to know you better.': ""
'I don''t expect to live in Orange Town for much longer. As soon as I find what I''m looking for I''m out of here.': ""
'I don''t follow.': ""
'I don''t have a chicken to enter the race, but Pom likes to see them running.': ""
'I don''t have enough weeds to make hay.': ""
'I don''t have room on my backpack to store the milk.': ""
'I don''t know what Serge had in mind, but I can''t teach Devin how to be dedicated. That''s not something one can simply learn.': ""
'I don''t know what''s in store for me there, but I do know one thing...': ""
'I don''t know why, but I''ve been thinking about you a lot recently.': ""
'I don''t know. Maybe she hasn''t matured yet.': ""
'I don''t know...<wait>': ""
'I don''t like that and I don''t take charity.': ""
'I don''t like this, but since it''s a gift I promise I''ll try to eat it.': ""
'I don''t like you that way.': ""
'I don''t need to take the train.': ""
'I don''t really care about candy day.': ""
'I don''t really care if people know I''m a witch or not, but I usually avoid mentioning it. I don''t want to cause any commotion.': ""
'I don''t really like that, but thank you anyway.': ""
'I don''t really like that, but thank you for your thoughts.': ""
'I don''t really think of you that way.': ""
'I don''t take charity, but that would be a terrible gift anyway.': ""
'I don''t take charity.': ""
'I don''t think Chloe sells this, but sure, let''s talk to her.': ""
'I don''t think I''ve seen you around here before. Are you a fan of mine?': ""
'I don''t think anyone can...': ""
'I don''t think she''ll be able to eat another one right now, but you can give her another fish tomorrow.': ""
'I don''t think that logic applies to animals.': ""
'I don''t want it now, maybe another day.': ""
'I don''t want it.': ""
'I don''t want to risk cutting down a tree that can still grow back.': ""
'I don''t work on the fields as much these days, but I can say it''s important to eat a lot so you don''t run out of stamina.': ""
'I drew an exotic table last night. I would like to show you, but I left it hidden in my room.': ""
'I envy Nathalia sometimes. It feels like she eats even more sugar than me, but her body handles it much better.': ""
'I feel like eating some pizza. Do you think Chloe will make me one now?': ""
'I finally got that Wanted Poster that Benjamin wants.': ""
'I finally got the Mummy Bandages that Annie needs. What a journey this was.': ""
'I forgot to water the cabbages yesterday. Three of them have already died. I need to pay more attention so it doesn''t happen again.': ""
'I gave a chocolate bar to the kids and a cake to Nathalia. She loves some sweets, so she wouldn''t miss the chance of getting some today.': ""
'I get bored very easily, so I try to read a lot to keep my mind busy.': ""
'I get it.': ""
'I got Phi a horse shaped cake for candy day. Did you give her anything yet?': ""
'I got distracted drawing some ideas on my notebook and didn''t see a customer come in.': ""
'I got the Pirate Diary. Now I need to give it to Karl.': ""
'I got them in a car accident when I was a kid. I spent the whole summer in the hospital after that.': ""
'I got them.': ""
'I grew up in my grandmother''s kitchen, and one of the things I inherited was her love of cooking.': ""
'I guess I am... Let''s go!': ""
'I guess I can finally check that house and get some sleep.': ""
'I guess it''s kind of a weird thing for a kid to want to be. My parents were pretty sure I''d give up on it by the time I was twelve.': ""
'I guess we are done here.': ""
'I guess we will have to wait until then.': ""
'I guess you''re right...': ""
'I guess...<wait><wait><wait> So can we use some knotted rope to find him?': ""
'I had a lot of fun today. And I can tell that the chickens are happy too.': ""
'I had a real good time tonight, thank you for taking me out, <name>!': ""
'I had a really good dream last night...<wait> Hey, <name>. What do you dream about?': ""
'I had a spare cake around, do you want it?': ""
'I had more pending work than I thought, so I had no choice but to cancel my plans for today.': ""
'I had not. Viktor has been telling me about it since forever, but I never felt like coming here.': ""
'I had so much fun last time... I wanted to spend time with you again.': ""
'I had so much fun today!': ""
'I had to buy oranges from the grocery store every time. I was always running out of money because of it.': ""
'I hate summer.': ""
'I hate those. Why would you want to give it to me?': ""
'I have <var:mailCount> new mail.': ""
'I have a large piece of land on the west side of your farm. It''s no good for crops, but you can raise all your animals there.': ""
'I have a lot of stuff to do today, but I just don''t feel like it.': ""
'I have heard all about her already: her name is Amy, she''s got long green hair and is super sweet to everyone. Do you know anyone like that?': ""
'I have no idea what you have to do to train your chicken, but congratulations for doing it well.': ""
'I have no new land to sell you at the moment.': ""
'I have no new mail.': ""
'I have nothing else to say.': ""
'I have one more thing to add to the table.': ""
'I have one new mail.': ""
'I have one. It''s called Turtle.': ""
'I have seen him going around with a list of people and food names, but I don''t know what he has in mind.': ""
'I have the flowers.': ""
'I have the most boring job in the whole universe. What do you say we switch jobs for a day?': ""
'I have the sugarcanes.': ""
'I have them here.': ""
'I have to be careful during fall. The number of times I stepped on leaves and slipped is too embarrassing to reveal.': ""
'I have to be strong. I can''t let my grandpa''s anger affect me so much.': ""
'I have to go': ""
'I have to go now, see you later!': ""
'I have to tell you, I''m really upset with Viktor.': ""
'I have to walk all over town while making deliveries or receiving shipments. It never gets easier.': ""
'I haven''t added anything new to that book in a while. What do you think I should write about next?': ""
'I haven''t heard from my parents in a while.': ""
'I haven''t seen it.': ""
'I haven''t spoken to anybody in the city for a while. It was always hard to keep in touch.': ""
'I heard Amanda managed to grow a <color:item>Chocolate Rose</color>. Can you believe it?': ""
'I heard that you once tried to run away from home, is that true?': ""
'I heard there''s a girl in the weather channel that looks just like me. I''d like to meet her someday.': ""
'I heard you are Stella''s cousin. I''ve met her before. I''m a farmer as well. The name is <name>.': ""
'I heard you can cook any simple pot recipe that way. Try making some tea or hot milk next time.': ""
'I heard you''re new in this town too. Did you move here by yourself? That takes some courage.': ""
'I help out at Brittany''s ranch and manage the store there. Stop by anytime you need to buy something.': ""
'I hid many different flower bouquets in this area. I''ll ask you to bring me some of them, one by one.': ""
'I hope <color:name>Devin</color> is not slacking around again. He needs to get serious about his work.': ""
'I hope I can make my brother build a snowman with me this year. He promised me he would.': ""
'I initially moved here because I was running away from her...': ""
'I invented something new last night: an automatic hammer.': ""
'I just can''t find the time to go mining with so much work to do on the forge.': ""
'I just can''t think of anything to send to my father.': ""
'I just don''t like how it tastes.': ""
'I just heard from Raphael that you''re not letting Cindy study anymore.': ""
'I just made a deal with Serge to receive a weekly shipment of assorted candies from the capital. I can''t wait to get my first box.': ""
'I just milked my best cow. It tasted delicious! When you treat your cows with love and respect, the quality of the milk will improve.': ""
'I just realized. The rain will make your farm much more plentiful, will it not?': ""
'I just wanted to let you unwind a little, like we did at the restaurant.': ""
'I just wanted to tell you something first.': ""
'I just... I could never say no to her. Somehow she always managed to make me do anything she wanted.': ""
'I keep getting distracted, but it''s how I have the best ideas.': ""
'I knew Devin had no chance, but I had hoped you would win this.': ""
'I knew it!': ""
'I knew it! My Pipin is the best chicken ever!': ""
'I knew it! Western is the best genre ever. I''m glad you see that too. We have to watch some movies together soon!': ""
'I knew you had it in you to become a great farmer! Your chicken is amazing.': ""
'I know I''m not a kid, but I deserve some candy too, right?': ""
'I know I''m not breaking my diet when I eat this, but I can''t help but feel like I''m overeating.': ""
'I know I''m weird. The other day I even heard some people calling me a robot because of the way I work.': ""
'I know a thing or two about magic. I''ve seen some of those tools in the past too.': ""
'I know everyone thinks I''m too lazy to do anything, but I like being nice to people.': ""
'I know his horse is way past his better days, but he''s hard working!': ""
'I know how it is. The forge takes all my time away and I can''t work on my hobbies either.': ""
'I know people think I''m just a picky eater, but my problem is far bigger than that.': ""
'I know she was just being mean, but deep down I''m always afraid that she was right.': ""
'I know that. It''s just...': ""
'I know well enough how hard it is. Grandpa won''t let me get any other job, even now that he hired Billy.': ""
'I know you will.': ""
'I know you''re just starting out and need to focus on making money, but flowers are important too.': ""
'I know you''re taking good care of your animals, so keep competing and you''ll eventually win.': ""
'I know, but I need a perfect one, so it would probably take me a long time looking for many different sticks until I can find the one.': ""
'I know, but there''s always something like that with me. I can never just eat what''s available.': ""
'I know...<wait> But he''s only here today because our parents want to control everything I do.': ""
'I learned it just for today! I hope it turned out all right.': ""
'I left him a message. I hope he''ll call me back.': ""
'I like it here. It''s a small and peaceful town, but it has everything I need.': ""
'I like living in Orange Town. You can clearly see the difference between seasons. It wasn''t like this in the city.': ""
'I like taking a good walk around town to see how the villagers are doing. Seeing everybody''s satisfaction is my payment!': ""
'I like that about him, but he will never reach the same numbers as us without changing the way he does business.': ""
'I like to drink a glass of wine everyday at lunch, but I always need to ask Serge to import some for me. Why is nobody making wine in this town?': ""
'I like to walk around the town. I get a chance to talk with many different people.': ""
'I like you too': ""
'I like you too!': ""
'I like you too.': ""
'I lost again. I really thought this time things would be different...': ""
'I lost it to the bank a couple years ago, but I''ve already changed my life. I''m working to get enough money to buy it back from you now.': ""
'I love Orange Town...<wait> But the winter colors are too depressing.': ""
'I love spring! It''s like seeing life overcoming every challenge.': ""
'I love that! Can I keep it?': ""
'I love to read, but some days I just can''t decide which book to pick.': ""
'I love weekends. I get some rest from the heavy work and focus on the paperwork instead.': ""
'I made a few snowballs today, just to be safe. Nobody will be throwing any at me without getting twice as many back.': ""
'I made some ice cream for dessert!': ""
'I managed to deliver my project at the last minute yesterday. Nothing like a good deadline to pressure us into being productive.': ""
'I managed to lift part of the spell so you can go back through the path you came in, but I can''t do much more than that.': ""
'I may not look like it, but I''m actually hundreds of years old.': ""
'I mean, what kind of farmer takes sass from carrots and potatoes? Spare the root and spoil the chili, that''s what I always say.': ""
'I mean... You don''t need to water your crops on rainy days.': ""
'I need her working on the farm. Besides, this has nothing to do with you two.': ""
'I need to go clean myself better, I even got tomato juice under my nails.': ""
'I need to go see Ilda. I shouldn''t let my work drift me away from my friends.': ""
'I need to keep track of how much candy Phi will get tomorrow. I can''t let her eat it all at once.': ""
'I need to pay more attention at work so I don''t make any more mistakes.': ""
'I need to think of a good revenge plan against <color:name>Phi</color>.': ""
'I need to work. I can''t allow my sisters to be better than me.': ""
'I never expected both of us to lose this competition.': ""
'I never thought so many people would be figuring me out here. It never happened anywhere else.': ""
'I noticed you found yourself a sickle. It will be very useful in the farm.': ""
'I often stare out the window at night, hoping to see a mischievous Saci doing his thing.': ""
'I once read a whole book of chicken facts. Did you know they have more bones in their necks than giraffes?': ""
'I only started working as a carpenter here two months ago. I''ve had many different jobs before, even as a farmer.': ""
'I promised to deliver some stuff from my job tomorrow, but I haven''t even started it. I think I''ll buy some soda. The sugar will help me work.': ""
'I really like that you''re here. Orange Town needs more dreamers.': ""
'I really love winter. It makes my soul happier.': ""
'I really thought <color:name><var:stellasChickName></color> would win the festival. Are you taking good care of her?': ""
'I really won? I''m as surprised as everybody else.': ""
'I remember one of them once slipped on a broken egg and ended up with a broken leg.': ""
'I respect that. You want to become a great farmer through your own efforts, right? I''m like that as well.': ""
'I ruined my breakfast again! Do you think you could ask my brother to make me a sandwich? He makes the best sandwiches ever, but I will never admit that to him.': ""
'I said I could take care of the Saci, but she insisted on it, so I gave her some money to go buy the bottle.': ""
'I saw a flower unbuttoning yesterday. It''s boring and takes too long.': ""
'I see you managed to fix my old axe. Don''t go around cutting every tree in the forest now, alright?': ""
'I see. If it were me, I would be dropping everything to work on something I like.': ""
'I see. So you''re not after me. And trading something you need is a wise move. I will do the same!': ""
'I see. That explains all the weeds growing wild.': ""
'I see. Well, if you''re going to be hanging around those parts, let me introduce myself and also give you a warning.': ""
'I see...': ""
'I see.<wait><wait> That does make sense.<wait>': ""
'I sent a letter to Melissa telling her to go graze in another field.': ""
'I should come here when Raphael is with me.': ""
'I should take this Chocolate Rose to Nathalia before it melts.': ""
'I should take this to Amanda before I pass out from the smell.': ""
'I shouldn''t have to work on sundays, but I still do it. At least this way I''m training even harder to be a better farmer.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Benjamin''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Bonnie''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Julia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Lucas'' crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Mia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Nathalia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Serge''s crops.': ""
'I showed my drawing to Raphael and he said it was a pretty good design for a beginner.': ""
'I specially didn''t think I would be getting close to people, as I''m only here temporarily.': ""
'I still feel bad whenever I''m unable to eat something.': ""
'I tell you, sometimes I think he wants to see me die.': ""
'I think I don''t need to know any details about that. Can you lend me a piece?': ""
'I think I had too much sugar yesterday. I should be more careful of what I eat.': ""
'I think I know who''s going to win the race today. I''ll tell you later if I got it right.': ""
'I think I left it there, near the entrance.': ""
'I think I''ll be coming here often from now on.': ""
'I think I''ll go drink something with Benjamin. He should have some free time today so we need to make good use of it.': ""
'I think I''ll try to cook it too. I wonder if I can make it right. Thank you so much for the gift, <name>!': ""
'I think I''m out of the loop here. What happened with you and the farm?': ""
'I think I''m starting to like you. And I wanted to know if you like me back, despite my flaws.': ""
'I think I''ve said too much!': ""
'I think probably every kid has wondered at least once, \"What do I want to be when I grow up?\"': ""
'I think she''s addicted to adrenaline. I''ve never seen her relaxing.': ""
'I think so... Yeah. I can ask him to lend you the book.': ""
'I think there''s a witch or a wizard living secretly in this town, but I couldn''t determine who it is yet.': ""
'I think today I''m gonna spend the day fishing.': ""
'I think we have enough flowers now.': ""
'I think we should explore the mountains. Maybe we can find a magical being?': ""
'I thought there was going to be free food here today.': ""
'I thought you were going to participate. Don''t you have a chicken?': ""
'I told <color:name>Phi</color> that eating mango with milk can kill you. I may have ruined her favorite snack.': ""
'I told her about you on my last letter. She''s happy to know that there are a lot of people my age here.': ""
'I told you, I like being a farmer.': ""
'I too, want to be more than a friend.': ""
'I tried to cut the dead cabbages on the farm yesterday, but accidentally cut the ones that were still growing. If things continue like this, there will be no crops left to harvest.': ""
'I tried to look into him so many times, but I have no clue where he even came from.': ""
'I tried to tell you, I was just doing something nice.': ""
'I tried to, but I always get lost, so I didn''t get very far.': ""
'I understand. I''ll be back when I get a new opportunity for you. See you later.': ""
'I understand... And thank you for still being my friend.': ""
'I used to eat too much cake. Sometimes I would eat three whole cakes per week. One day I decided I needed to slow it down, so I turned wednesdays into cake days.': ""
'I used to think it would be cool. I had no idea how much work it is.': ""
'I usually go to the mountains to train new dance moves where nobody is watching.': ""
'I usually lose seven, but I once managed to harvest 5 whole turnips from a box with 10 seeds. It''s my personal record.': ""
'I usually teleport to the forest entrance so that people won''t freak out when I show up in the middle of town.': ""
'I wanna try grabbing a fish with my bare hands. It should be fun.': ""
'I want a <color:item>handcuff</color>.': ""
'I want the summer to come faster. The rivers are waiting for me.': ""
'I want to be your friend': ""
'I want to date you.': ""
'I want to improve my cooking skills, so I picked a cookbook from the library yesterday. What recipe do you think I should try first?': ""
'I want to make a new magic wand, but I want it to be perfect. For that I''ll need to have a good wooden stick to begin with.': ""
'I want to make you a Magic Ribbon. If I do, you will be able to use teleport magic, just like me.': ""
'I want to understand why my brother did everything that he did.': ""
'I want to work the earth and enjoy the fruits of my labor...literally.': ""
'I wanted to go ice skating, but I would probably get hurt.': ""
'I wanted to grow some flowers... At least I would have something to gift Bonnie or Raphael.': ""
'I wanted to read a new pirate book, but <color:name>Nathalia</color> gets mad that I don''t return the books, now I can''t borrow them anymore.': ""
'I wanted to show you that you''re not a robot.': ""
'I wanted to spend time with you': ""
'I wanted to thank you for being a good friend.': ""
'I was a bit anxious when I noticed I had a new letter on my inbox today, but it was just my aunt Dulce wanting to know how I''m doing.': ""
'I was actually wondering about that...': ""
'I was just a small kid when I ran away, even younger than you are now. And dad found me just two days later.': ""
'I was just wondering if you want to hang out.': ""
'I was never taught how to react to this, but thank you very much, <name>!': ""
'I was only trying to have some fun, I never thought I would win the games!': ""
'I was passing by and thought I would say hello.': ""
'I was so embarassed in the parking space. I knew nobody would talk to us. I would have no chance with the ladies.': ""
'I was thinking about summoning my sister to do some paperwork at the town hall. She no longer does the heavy work on her farm anyway.': ""
'I was thinking of procuring some new books for the library... What titles should I prioritize? It''s such a dilemma...': ""
'I was trying to make mayo with today''s eggs from the farm. Should be super simple right? Just put some oil and an egg on the blender.': ""
'I was walking on the mountains until I saw a little girl crawled there, holding a strainer against the ground.': ""
'I will buy when I get the money.': ""
'I wish I could be in the city. They have movies and also a big harbor there.': ""
'I wish I could be strong like her.': ""
'I wish I could be working on something else.': ""
'I wish I could meet the Spring Queen some day. We would have a lot of things to talk about.': ""
'I wish I could stay in bed all day long.': ""

'I wish I could use my time to work on my own projects instead.': ""
'I wish I had some work that involved creating something different. Something that really pushed my creativity.': ""
'I wish I had someone... who could help me become strong... Bonnie helps me a lot, but I need more...': ""
'I wish my brother would stop working, at least on sundays.': ""
'I woke up with sore muscles today. I need to be more careful not to overwork too much, or my perfomance will be affected the next day.': ""
'I won''t be able to eat it anymore, it smells so bad! Maybe I should try to grow my own roses from now on.': ""
'I won''t drink it yet because it would make me sleepy, but thank you!': ""
'I wonder how he knows that white roses are my favorite.': ""
'I wonder if <color:name>Nathalia</color> is busy tonight. We could eat some pizza together like we always do.': ""
'I wonder if I can find a new place to build another garden. Julia probably won''t mind.': ""
'I wonder if anyone in Orange Town can fix this broken axe I found.': ""
'I wonder if we can use some of those flowers to decorate the chicken festival later this month.': ""
'I wonder what <color:name>Chloe</color> will do for lunch today. I''m getting hungry just thinking about it.': ""
'I wonder what kind of creature could have put it there. It was not done by any witch.': ""
'I wonder why they do... It tastes so bad.': ""
'I worked a lot this week, I think I can take some time to myself. I wonder if Raphael wants to go out tomorrow.': ""
'I would be happy, at the very least. Thank you for the surprise!': ""
'I would be just like Cindy! The difference is that I would be my own Rory as well!': ""
'I would like a turtle too.': ""
'I would love to, but right now I got a lot of work to do.': ""
'I would love to, but right now I have to work.': ""
'I would not be myself anymore.': ""
'I would often have some good friends studying together and having pizza. My college time was quite fun.': ""
'I would rather be eating those tomatoes...': ""
'I would spend even more time with her if I could, but I''m already ashamed of how much I bother her.': ""
'I wouldn''t mind if it were a bit colder. I think the flowers could still endure it.': ""
'I''d be trying to focus on my work and he would be constantly running around wanting attention.': ""
'I''d better stay away from the flowers. I don''t want to find any bees.': ""
'I''d imagine there''s a lot of people around here that don''t even know I live in this town. Not that I mind that.': ""
'I''ll also give you some basic seeds so you can get started on your farm.': ""
'I''ll be going home now. Good luck!': ""
'I''ll be going now. Make good use of it!': ""
'I''ll be keeping an eye on all participants. If anyone isn''t taking good care of their animals, I''ll know.': ""
'I''ll be rooting for Richard''s brother this year. Don''t throw any tomatoes on him, alright?': ""
'I''ll buy it.': ""
'I''ll deliver your rooster when the festival ends.': ""
'I''ll do my best!': ""
'I''ll do that! It shouldn''t take me too long to get that many.': ""
'I''ll go back home now, good luck with your farm.': ""
'I''ll go take a walk in the mountains, see you later.': ""
'I''ll have to pay him a visit and chat a little, I''m curious how he''s like.': ""
'I''ll keep an eye on you. Make me proud, <boy>.': ""
'I''ll see if I can find anything.': ""
'I''ll show you something nice now, hang on.': ""
'I''ll start with those three.': ""
'I''ll start working on your house tomorrow. Look forward to it.': ""
'I''ll try to keep an open mind.': ""
'I''ll wait, but everyone else is ready so please don''t take long.': ""
'I''ll wait, but hurry please.': ""
'I''ll write down this recipe for <color:item><var:newRecipeName></color>.': ""
'I''ll... be careful. I promise.': ""
'I''ll...<wait><wait> check up on you later.': ""
'I''ll...<wait><wait> see what I can do.': ""
'I''ll...keep that in mind.': ""
'I''ll...try to catch a cold sometime.': ""
'I''m <name>. I moved here to become a farmer.': ""
'I''m Billy, the previous owner of the farm you''re currently living on.': ""
'I''m Richard, why?': ""
'I''m afraid to lose your friendship now, but there''s something that I need to tell you.': ""
'I''m already tired. I think I''ll go to bed soon.': ""
'I''m already working on your house. The job will be complete soon.': ""
'I''m always thinking about the farm and all the work.': ""
'I''m always trying to draw new buildings or furniture, but it''s hard to think up of something.': ""
'I''m bored, but I don''t want to work.': ""
'I''m carrying a bunch of snowballs. <color:name>Phi</color> won''t know what hit her.': ""
'I''m challenging myself this month. I''m trying to grow as many flowers as possible without affecting the monthly goal for crops and animal products.': ""
'I''m doing well. What about you?': ""
'I''m fine with going to the city, but do I really need to study?': ""
'I''m going to give it everything I''ve got!': ""
'I''m gonna assume that you also forgot to get yourself a <color:important>hoe</color> and give you an old one too.': ""
'I''m gonna cook without any utensil.': ""
'I''m good': ""
'I''m happy to hear that she moved out of there as well.': ""
'I''m happy to hear that! Let''s have something together sometime.': ""
'I''m happy to hear that.': ""
'I''m happy to see you''re still around, <name>! Farming is not an easy job, a lot of people would''ve given up already.': ""
'I''m here everytime you need me!': ""
'I''m here this morning to present you with a unique opportunity.': ""
'I''m just joking. Here''s the Ribbon, make good use of it!': ""
'I''m just messin'' with ya. My dad told me.': ""
'I''m looking forward to knowing you better, <name>!': ""
'I''m looking forward to watching some movies with you.': ""
'I''m lucky if anybody gives me anything at all. I would never expect flowers or gifts.': ""
'I''m making a special tool and there''s a very rare item that I need, but it may be a little unusual.': ""
'I''m not a big fan of dance clubs and that seems like a lot of trouble just to get to one.': ""
'I''m not a stranger--I live here on a farm. I''m <name>.': ""
'I''m not going to quit without trying.': ""
'I''m not really used to having friends, but I''ve been treated really well by Devin, Nathalia, Chloe and specially you.': ""
'I''m not very good at this game, but I have a lot of fun, so I''m gonna play too.': ""
'I''m picking some flowers for a bouquet. I''m planning to send it to my mother.': ""
'I''m ready': ""
'I''m really happy! Cocoa won the race again.': ""
'I''m really hungry right now.': ""
'I''m really impressed, the farm is much bigger than I thought it would be.': ""
'I''m so excited about this project.': ""
'I''m so glad I moved out from grandpa''s house. Now I don''t have to listen to him comparing me to Stella anymore.': ""
'I''m so happy to hear that!': ""
'I''m so happy you moved here, <name>.': ""
'I''m sorry <name>, I can''t right now.': ""
'I''m sorry <name>, but I need to go to bed now. See you tomorrow.': ""
'I''m sorry <name>, but I need to go to work now. See you later.': ""
'I''m sorry <name>, but it''s getting late. I need to go to bed. See you tomorrow.': ""
'I''m sorry but I can''t talk much today, <name>. I have too much work to do.': ""
'I''m sorry, I''m not used to winning in anything.': ""
'I''m sorry.': ""
'I''m sorry. Rory does seem like someone who is hard to deal with.': ""
'I''m sorry?': ""
'I''m starting to enjoy those conversations. It still feels awkward because I don''t know what I should be saying, but I''m liking it.': ""
'I''m starting to like you as more than just a friend.': ""
'I''m starting to think that this place is not too bad.': ""
'I''m still looking': ""
'I''m still out of money constantly, but at least now I''m using it to buy toys.': ""
'I''m still working on your stuff, so I can''t do any other work right now.': ""
'I''m sure': ""
'I''m sure it did, but why go through all that trouble?': ""
'I''m surprised to see Devin participating in this. Don''t go easy on him, all right?': ""
'I''m telling you this because I wanted you to know how I am.': ""
'I''m thankful for all the gifts that I love, but try to keep it down, alright? I don''t want people to start talking about us.': ""
'I''m tired of working already, please tell me the day is almost over.': ""
'I''m tired of you yelling at me all the time and telling me what to do. I''m gonna live my own life from now on.': ""
'I''m too busy to take care of a turtle.': ""
'I''m too tired to go back outside.': ""
'I''m trying to think of some new moves. Do you have any suggestion?': ""
'I''m... a farmer.': ""
'I''ve already finished the first chapter, titled <color:important>Shipping</color>.': ""
'I''ve already traveled all over the world, but I like living here because of it''s a peaceful place, filled with nature.': ""
'I''ve always been better at managing the ranch than working on it.': ""
'I''ve always wanted to do something romantic with someone, so I''m really happy to be here with you today.': ""
'I''ve been doing well so far, so I guess I can skip a day if she doesn''t hear about it.': ""
'I''ve been enjoying my time here in Orange Town, hopefully I won''t need to move away anytime soon.': ""
'I''ve been living here for two years now and the town has only improved during this time.': ""
'I''ve been thinking about introducing some new dishes to the restaurant menu. What do you think?': ""
'I''ve been thinking about my dream again. I wonder if I could do some drawings in secret.': ""
'I''ve been thinking of you as well, <name>...': ""
'I''ve been trying to apply that to my daily life as well.': ""
'I''ve brought you that welcoming gift that I mentioned before.': ""
'I''ve lived in Orange Town all my life. Someday, I''d love to travel abroad to experience different cultures, and try different cuisine.': ""
'I''ve never talked to them again after they kicked me out, but sometimes grandpa will mention how they are doing.': ""
'I''ve placed an offering here. I wonder what will happen to it.': ""
'I''ve really thought about what you said to me last time. About deserving a break.': ""
'I''ve ruined it.': ""
'I''ve seen the way you look at me. And it''s okay, I like you a lot too.': ""
'I''ve tried so many times to eat different stuff, but it can be so hard.': ""
'I''ve waited a whole year for summer to come back. Let''s go for a swim!': ""
'I... don''t know yet, but I''ll come back when I think of something.': ""
'I...<wait> I wish I could help you.': ""
'If Brittany comes to visit as usual, I hope she''ll at least bring me a cake.': ""
'If I do it only when I''m alone in my room, maybe he''ll never find out.': ""
'If I enjoy it and it makes me stay active through the whole day, why should I change?': ""
'If I go home now, I''ll miss the rest of the festival...': ""
'If I keep doing that, I won''t lose my friends again.': ""
'If I put animal feed in the storage, I can quickly retrieve it here.': ""
'If I put bird feed in the storage, I can quickly retrieve it here.': ""
'If I put ingredients here, I can cook something with them.': ""
'If I wasn''t a blacksmith, I''d be the best farmer in town for sure. I''ll be glad to take you under my wing, if you want. You''ll be rolling in cabbage in no time flat, both the crunchy and spendable kind.': ""
'If I''m not working, I can''t relax.': ""
'If all you had to do was make a hole in the ground, I would''ve been a farmer since I was 3.': ""
'If he doesn''t show up to pick the shipments, let me know.': ""
'If only she worked hard on the farm, he wouldn''t yell at her that much.': ""
'If people ever get tired of oranges, I could make this our town''s main product.': ""
'If there''s something you don''t know, just ask me. I''m pretty knowledgeable about all kinds of stuff, y''know. Whether it''s farming, dating or mining, I''ve got all sorts of pro advice for ya.': ""
'If they sent you here to convince me to go home, forget it. I won''t leave without my dog.': ""
'If we could get a third farm getting famous for something, the town itself would be recognized for it''s agriculture.': ""
'If you bring him some sugarcane rum as a gift, maybe he''ll talk to you.': ""
'If you can get one for me, I''ll trade you the diary for it.': ""
'If you don''t have any products from your farm, you can go forage on the mountains, hit the mines or even go fishing. There''s no excuse not to sell anything.': ""
'If you have the instructions and you can get the right materials, why not?': ""
'If you haven''t been to the mountains yet, you totally should. You can forage a lot of stuff there.': ""
'If you need any help or advice, he''ll be glad to help you out.': ""
'If you need any more buildings, or even fences for your farm, come check what I have for sale on my store.': ""
'If you need any supplies, please let me know.': ""
'If you need any supplies, please visit the general store.': ""
'If you need information about agriculture, please stop by the library. I''ll introduce you to the glorious world of vast knowledge.': ""
'If you need livestock or ranching supplies, you should talk to Stella.': ""
'If you need livestock or ranching supplies, you should visit my sister Brittany''s ranch and talk to Stella.': ""
'If you need some quick cash, you should buy some Lettuce Seeds and sow them on your farm. They grow quite fast.': ""
'If you need some quick cash, you should buy some Onion Seeds and sow them on your farm. They grow relatively fast for a summer crop.': ""
'If you need some quick cash, you should buy some Radish or Carrot Seeds and sow them on your farm. They grow relatively fast for a fall crop.': ""
'If you need some quick cash, you should buy some Turnip Seeds and sow them on your farm. They grow very fast.': ""
'If you need to buy seeds or other farming supplies, Serge is selling some of my excess stock in the general store.': ""
'If you pet and feed her often, she''ll grow attached to you. If that happens, she''ll let you carry her around.': ""
'If you ran out of space in your farm, you will need to find a sickle, hammer or axe to help clear the weeds, rocks and logs that are lying around.': ""
'If you run out of stamina, you may collapse, so make sure you always carry something with you to eat if you''re feeling weak.': ""
'If you see Devin slacking off at the store, please let me know.': ""
'If you see her anywhere, please let me know.': ""
'If you see my little dog Pom anywhere, please let me know. Once I find her I''ll go back home.': ""
'If you win the chicken festival, your farm''s brand will get some recognition and I''ll be able to sell your eggs for more.': ""
'If you''re not doing anything else, would you like to hang out?': ""
'If you''re not interested in breeding, you can leave your animals outside so that they can grow stronger. When animals sleep outside they don''t need you to feed them.': ""
'If you''re running low on stamina, you can recover it by <color:important>eating food<color:default>.': ""
'If you''ve achieved that and still got some free time to do something you enjoy, you have every right to it.': ""

'You have a finite amount of energy to do farm work. Watering crops, chopping wood, tending to you animals — all of those things consume stamina.': ""
'You have bought every kitchen utensil I had, so I decided to offer you the best items on my catalog.': ""
'You have no chance against me.': ""
'You jinxed me, <dude>.': ""
'You just aim it at what you want to hammer and press a button. It will automatically hit the target for as long as you keep the button pressed.': ""
'You know how much work I could''ve done while we wait?': ""
'You know how to make a girl happy, don''t you?': ""
'You know why. I need to get myself a girlfriend.': ""
'You know, <name>. After the last pizza slice you gave me, I talked to Bonnie and decided to go into a diet.': ""
'You know, Gabriel is the only person in Orange Town that I know nothing about.': ""
'You leave me speechless... Thank you! They are beautiful.': ""
'You lost your boots...': ""
'You lost? Are you sure you''re taking good care of your chicken?': ""
'You may even be able to find some useful tools there.': ""
'You may not have any callus on your hands, but I bet you have some on your feet by now.': ""
'You mean Lucas? He''s been living here longer than me.': ""
'You mean your chicken?': ""
'You must be kidding!': ""
'You need $ 20,000 to buy this small bag.': ""
'You need $ 5,000 to buy a rooster, <name>.': ""
'You need $ 5,000 to buy this small bag.': ""
'You need all the energy you can get to run that farm of yours. A good hearty breakfast will put a spring in your step.': ""
'You need to sit down and grab a bite to eat.': ""
'You picked the wrong bouquet, <name>. You can try again, or skip to the next bouquet.': ""
'You really do? I was really afraid you were going to say something else.': ""
'You really got it? Thank you so much, darling. Here''s the Mummy Bandages I promised.': ""
'You really think so?': ""
'You should definitely buy a horse first thing. Horses are beautiful and awesome and riding is super-duper convenient.': ""
'You should eat at <color:name>Chloe</color>''s restaurant from time to time. Her food will give you the strength you need to do your work.': ""
'You should let her do what she likes.': ""
'You should raise a lot of animals on your farm, <name>. Animals are cute, useful and even give you good things like eggs and milk.': ""
'You should try harder next time.': ""
'You shouldn''t run around in the rain so much. You may get sick!': ""
'You surprised me now. I didn''t expect you to have a turtle with you.': ""
'You there! Do you know where Orange Town is?': ""
'You think so?': ""
'You want to give it to Nathalia, right? I''m willing to trade it.': ""
'You want to see if I''ll skip a day on my diet again, after so much pizza. Isn''t that right?': ""
'You were always nice to us, why wouldn''t we be nice to you as well?': ""
'You were still looking for that? I have already completed the Magic Ribbon a long time ago.': ""
'You weren''t here last year. Are you living on that farm?': ""
'You will? Thank you so much, <name>.': ""
'You will? What a little darling you are.': ""
'You worry too much about that, Benjamin. How could you''ve known?': ""
'You wouldn''t find a worse gift even if you tried.': ""
'You youngsters know nothing about life. Do you think I should just let her live here for free?': ""
'You''ll be toiling from dawn to dusk every single day, rain or shine. I don''t want to hear any complaining from you either. If you''ve got time to complain, you''ve got time to shut up and work.': ""
'You''ll come see me when that happens, right? It won''t be cheap, but I''ll fix you up good as new.': ""
'You''ll find someone.': ""
'You''ll make me blush. What should I do when I receive something I love?': ""
'You''re a really good carpenter.': ""
'You''re as much a farmer as I am, maybe even more. Certainly more than Billy is.': ""
'You''re flesh and bones just like me.': ""
'You''re giving me a diamond? Wow, thank you so much, <name>! I love it.': ""
'You''re going to sleep? I''ll go home then.': ""
'You''re just starting out, right? You should try to find more tools.': ""
'You''re lucky. The nature is doing your work for you today. I don''t get the same chance with my job.': ""
'You''re making a lot more effort to talk to me than most people do. Are you trying to be my friend?': ""
'You''re no fun.': ""
'You''re not a kid in school anymore. Now you get a chance to befriend people that like you for who you are.': ""
'You''re painting this much worse than it is. I don''t think anyone would mind making something extra for you.': ""
'You''re right. Let me check the list of materials...<wait>': ""
'You''re thinking of moving away from Orange Town?': ""
'You''re very considerate, we can''t deny that, but I have to go now! I need to fill this potbelly.': ""
'You''re wasting time with those drawings again?': ""
'You''ve been living here for a while now, but I feel like I don''t know you that well yet.': ""
'You''ve met Julia, right <name>? She''s the best thing that ever happened to this town.': ""
'You''ve probably noticed by now that I really like to see Gabriel''s show, right?': ""
You.: ""
'You...<wait> You really want to?': ""
'Your body...<wait>': ""
'Your brother situation was completely different. I won''t be able to help you understand him.': ""
'Your brother thinks of you as his hero. All he wants is to spend time with you.': ""
'Your chicken is very happy that she won. I can tell she likes you.': ""
'Your chicken ran so fast in there. Near the end I thought she was going to jump to your face and peck your eye out.': ""
'Your chicken runs very fast. What does she eat everyday to get so strong?': ""
'Your chicken was looking at me earlier. It felt like she was staring into my soul.': ""
'Your collection...': ""
'Your dedication... Your focus...': ""
'Your father told you to spoil us a little, so we would always go to his store?': ""
'Your furniture and other belongings arrived here yesterday. You''ll find them inside.': ""
'Your hard work will help Orange Town grow. If you need any help, don''t hesitate to ask.': ""
'Your house was the first one that was completely built by me. How''s it holding up?': ""
'Your parents asked me to have someone pick you up at the station, but I had some time today so I decided to be the one to welcome you.': ""
'Your prize will be delivered by mail tomorrow morning.': ""
'Your prizes will be delivered to your homes tomorrow, don''t forget to check your mailbox.': ""
'Your rooster...': ""
'Your stamina depletes as you work. Everytime you use tools it will go down a little bit, but it''s not really a problem if you eat and rest well.': ""
'Your stamina will go down much faster when you''re suffering from fatigue, so you have to be extra careful.': ""
'Your sweat...<wait>': ""
'Yup! I remember you liked it back then, so I made another for you.': ""
'Yup, that''s me. The name is <name>.': ""
Yup.: ""
'Yup. But don''t tell anyone, alright? You didn''t freak out when I showed up in front of you so I don''t mind telling now, but other people may have different reactions.': ""
